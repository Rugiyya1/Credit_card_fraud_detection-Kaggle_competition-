# Credit_card_fraud_detection-Kaggle_competition-
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Credit Card Fraud Detection. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original.

- All features are numerical
- V1 - V28 are PCA obtained components, only 'time' and 'amount' have not been transformed with PCA
- 'time' indicates seconds elapsed between transaction and first transaction
- 'amount' is the transaction amount
- 'class'  - 1 is fraud
